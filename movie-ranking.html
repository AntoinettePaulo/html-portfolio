<h1>The Best Movies/Series According to Antoinette</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies/Series of All-Time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Queen of Tears</h3>
<p>I love this because the characters really showed emotions and I somehow felt connected to the characters. It was heartwarming.</p>
<h3>A Walk to Remember</h3>
<p>I really loed this movies because it was a message on how not to take time and loved ones for granted plus always be nice to people because you will never know what they are going through.</p>
<h3>Goblin</h3>
<p>It was a romcom, that's why I loved it. The plot was just chef's kiss! I cried alot on that show.</p>
